By default, Project Manager icon size is 32x32, but it can be permanently changed by overriding these files by the files of any available folder here or running svg2png.bat (requires Inkscape-program) to generate custom side length icons. (Please note that Workspace icon size is permanently set to 16x16 and its 'icons (16x16)'-folder should not be deleted.)
